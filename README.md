### Maintenance and Scalability

This project is no longer maintained, maybe in the future I might add some extra features or routes.
Feel free to download it and adapt it to your own project, the project is easy to understand and it is a good starting point to develop larger backends.
The models, routes and authentication are scalable and easily maintenable.
